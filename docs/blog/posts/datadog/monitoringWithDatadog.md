## Overview About Monitoring

Datadog excels at collecting a wide range of metrics from various sources, including systems, applications, and custom integrations.

### What Will We Monitor?

#### 1. WORK METRICS
Work metrics indicate the top-level health of your system by measuring its useful output. These metrics are invaluable for surfacing real, often user-facing issues. They include:
- **Throughput:** The amount of work the system is doing per unit time.
- **Success Metrics:** The percentage of work executed successfully.
- **Error Metrics:** The rate of errors per unit time or per unit of work.
- **Performance Metrics:** Efficiency measurements, such as latency.

#### 2. RESOURCE METRICS
Resource metrics provide insights into the components of your software infrastructure. Key areas to cover:
- **Utilization:** Percentage of time the resource is busy.
- **Saturation:** Measure of the amount of requested work that cannot yet be serviced.
- **Errors:** Internal errors not observable in the work output.
- **Availability:** Percentage of time the resource responded to requests.

#### 3. EVENTS
Events provide crucial context for understanding system behavior changes. Examples include:
- **Code Changes:** Releases, builds, and build failures.
- **Alerts:** Notifications from monitoring systems or third-party tools.
- **Scaling Events:** Adding or subtracting hosts or containers.

### Introducing Graphs

#### 1. TIMESERIES
Line graphs visualize metric data, useful for:
- Spotting outliers, tracking single metrics, or spotting individual deviations.
- Stacked Area Graphs show sum and part contributions at a glance.

#### 2. SUMMARY GRAPHS
- **Single-Value Summaries:** Highlight key metrics visibly.
- **Toplists:** Rank segments by metric values, useful for spotting outliers.
- **Change Graphs:** Compare current metric values against past values.
- **Host Maps:** Visualize resource utilization and identify issues.
- **Distributions:** Histogram of metric values across infrastructure.
